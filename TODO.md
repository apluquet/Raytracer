# TODO

These are some things to update of implement in the future (no priority):

* Split Scene.intersectObject in two functions and move distance check from Phong.get_texture().
* Compute radius^2 in Sphere constructor rather than at every intersection.
* Scene loader (gltf)
* Options parser (resolution, .obj file, )
* Coverage analysis (and optimisation)
* Refactor file structure (create folders, rename 'utils')
* Use smart pointers
* Blob material: get material from object ?
* Obj and scene boundaries
* Free
* Change FOV compute to avoid distorted image
* KD trees
* FBM texture procedural generation
